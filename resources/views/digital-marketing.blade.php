                 A significant number of individuals in Nigeria are plugged into either television or the internet,
                 constantly immersed in a barrage of commercials. This opens the door for capturing the attention of
                 nearly the entire country's population on a daily basis.
                 <br><br>
                 Research further emphasizes the potency of social media management, revealing that a compelling video
                 ad influences a remarkable 60% to make a purchase, surpassing the 40% influenced by social media
                 adverts.
                 <br><br>
                 Yet, the realm of social media management, much like video commercials, has its dual nature. While some
                 brands have struck gold with successful campaigns, others are still navigating the landscape.
